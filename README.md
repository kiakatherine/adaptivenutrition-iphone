# AdaptiveNutrition - iPhone

## Getting Started
This repository is built using [Expo](https://expo.io/) & [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).  Developers should install and familiarize themselves with these technologies when working with this repository.

You'll also want to install the [Expo Client](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779?mt=8) app on your iPhone. This will allow you to see code changes in real time on your iPhone.

To get started, install [Expo](https://expo.io/) and the latest version of NodeJS.  Then, in the root directory of this repository, execute the command:

```sh
> exp start
```

This will generate a QR code you can scan with your iPhone in the Expo Client app.  Scan the QR code and see your code changes applied in real time!
